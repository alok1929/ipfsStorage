## Web application running on solidity using IPFS protocol for storing and transferring NFTs and photos
# How It Works 
This is a dApp for a decentralized application with a simple frontend connected with a set of backend services composed by a Smart contract
## Packages Required

-  ├── dotenv-webpack@8.0.1
-   ├── dotenv@16.3.1
-    ├── express@4.18.2

### Front End languages Used: 
HTML, TailwindCSS, JS
### Backend languages used:
